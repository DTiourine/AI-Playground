# Machine Learning Starter Projects

This repository contains a series of neural network projects I implemented in PyTorch on beginner level datasets such as FashionMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR10. The primary goal is to get some hands-on practice with PyTorch and develop my skills, enabling me to familiarize myself with the framework and prepare for more advanced projects and challenges in machine learning and deep learning.

## Classification

Projects focusing on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other techniques to classify images from various datasets.

### FashionMNIST Neural Network

- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Key Concepts**: Image classification, CNN architecture, PyTorch basics

### EMNIST Letter Recognition

- **Objective**: Recognize handwritten letters from the EMNIST dataset
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Key Concepts**: Handwritten character recognition, data augmentation, regularization

### CIFAR10 Image Classification

- **Objective**: Classify objects from the CIFAR10 dataset into 10 categories
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
