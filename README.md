# Machine Learning Starter Projects

This repository contains a series of neural network projects I implemented in PyTorch on beginner level datasets such as FashionMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR10. The primary goal is to get some hands-on practice with PyTorch and develop my skills, enabling me to familiarize myself with the framework and prepare for more advanced projects and challenges in machine learning and deep learning.

## Image Classification

Projects focusing on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other techniques to classify images from various datasets.

- **FashionMNIST Classifier**: Utilizes a CNN to classify fashion items.
- **CIFAR10 Object Recognition**: Implements advanced neural architectures to recognize objects.
